We are ***Team Mean Sqares*** and we are learning various Linear Regression methods in depth through this project. The Housing Prices data set from Kaggel is pretty elaborate with about 80 features. Even though it has limited amount of observations, we think we can get enough hands on experience.  

***Our objective is :***
1. Experience EDA and data munging
2. Explore the inner workings of multiple Regression algorithms
3. Learning the methodologies right, instead of tweaking just for Kaggle score 
3. Submit data to Kaggel to check how we compare 
4. Have fun while doing this :-)

Toolset : **Python, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn** 

Github Source : [MNN](https://github.com/radhavrmk/MNN)

Data : [Kaggle Home Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

Presentation: Can be found in this repository

About the Notebooks: This was a team effort and and multiple notebooks were created in parallel. Start with notebooks with names starting with "FINAL" and "Kaggle". As we get time, We would like to clean this repository and organize the code into few Python files and notebooks
